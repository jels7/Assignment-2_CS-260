In order to design a queue data structure we would need the following functions:

    enqueue (insert): Adds an element to the back of the queue
    dequeue (delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue
    isEmpty: Will check to see if the queue is empty
    isFull: Will check to see if the queue is full

For the queue to function properly, we would need the following values:

    The front and back pointers of the queue
    The number of elements in the queue

To design a list data structure that would allow insertion and deletion at a given location, we would need the following functions:

    insert: inserts an element at a specific position in the list
    delete: deletes the element at a specific position in t he list
    isEmpty: will check if the list is empty
    size: returns the number of elements in the list

For the list to function properly, we would need these values:

    The head pointer
    Number of elements in the list
    The position of each element within the list
